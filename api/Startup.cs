            This is not suitable for generation of token as it is one time activity hence not used.
            AddScoped() : this is type of service gets instantiated when HTTP request is received.
            it gets terminated when HTTP request is served or done.
            hence this is very suitable for the issuing of JWT token hence it is used.

            AddTransient() : this type of service lifetime is until the execution of given method.
            It gets terminated once method is finished.
